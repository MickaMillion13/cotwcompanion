### **Support Me**

You can support me through [PayPal](https://paypal.me./toastovac). It is the only way I use for now.
It will be appreciated a lot. It also encourages me to update this app. Thank you everyone who
already did or will do.

### **Some history and staff**

The app was released on **27th of November 2020** on Android's Google Play. It offered
few base info about animals and that was it. During the year 2021 the app got a significantly more
info, regarding reserves, weapons, callers, and options for changing theme or language. The app
also got maps with hunting zones for each animal as well as locations of outposts and lookouts.
Nowadays the app offers features like need zones changing over time, catch book and trophy lodge to
log your hunting trophies, and newest addition, loadouts, offering you a way to see if you are
able to shoot or lure the animal. The app was also released for iOS users. The app still is
and I hope will be in development state so additional features will come eventually. I think the
app is a good way to keep the game's data by your side at any time (it works offline).
You also do not have to remember everything.

### **What about issues and features?**

I would like to appeal to everyone that not everything would be correct and mistakes can happen.
There is also an info that is missing. In these cases feel free to contact me about it through the
email or discord provided in the app's *About* info. Everything about planned features or issues
can be found here.

### **What about updates?**

The updates usually take me **2 - 3 weeks** to process. Do not forget that I am alone and it will
take time (especially when there is a new map). I am always responding to huge amount of reviews
(that contain questions about the update) always the same way. It takes (literally everytime)
me a lot of time so the updates will **not** be literally the day after the game updated for sure.
But the update will come eventually.

### **Thank you!**

For those who at least mentioned the app anywhere and especially for those who regularly use my
app: Thank you very much for your support and reviews you gave me. I appreciate it a lot. To this
day, the app was used at least once by almost **23K** users on Android and by almost **5K** users
on iOS. Which is totally awesome and I did not think this could be possible. Without you I probably
would not be able to release the app for iOS devices.
